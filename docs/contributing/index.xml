Kubeflow is a machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes that contains several projects for different purposes.
Both projects share the same goal to enable machine learning run on Kubernetes, but largely solve different problems, or in different approaches, or can complement each other in this area.
KubeDL modeling lineage and versioning: KubeDL tracks the history of a model in the native Kubernetes CRD format which is unique and easy for existing Kubernetes users to adopt and can leverage broad Kubernetes tooling ecosystem.</description></item></channel></rss>
